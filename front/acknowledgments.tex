\section*{Acknowledgments}
In the six months that lead to this thesis, I received a great deal of support from many people.
First, I'd like to thank my supervisors, Prof. Bruni and Prof. Gori, for the guidance and the help. They pointed me in the right direction at the beginning, and provided interesting cues without which substantial parts of this work wouldn't exist.

At the personal level, the development of this thesis would have caused a fair deal of stress even on a normal period, and it happened during the pandemic, so I want to thank all who helped me through it. I apologize in advance to people I'm forgetting to name, but you really are a lot and I can't remember you all right now.
I thank my family, my parents and my brother, for the support they gave me. They were always supportive of my studies and
I thank my friends from the university years, Alessandro, Beppe, Bruno, Elia, Enrico, Guido, Niccol√≤, Pasquale e Sofia: these last years flown by, and during the pandemic the meals with you indeed mattered.
I thank my friends from the d\&d party, Dario, Gibbo, Gozzi, Manuel, Marco, Mors, Palla, Tara: I don't know how you felt about it, but those weekly meetings, even though remotely, really meant a lot for me.
I want to thank all the people I got to know through PCW. I can't list them all because they really are a lot, but never would I have imagined that small edit on Pino in 2013 would have become an important part of my life. Most of our interactions being virtual, my relationship with you didn't changed too much with the pandemic, and that isle of ``normality" were very welcome.
Lastly, I thank my other group of friends from the high-school years, Alge, Boss, Dario, Fra, Gozzi, Gulia, Miki, Nico, Otti, Turlea: your friendship really is dear to me, and I'm grateful for the times we were able to meet (both in person and remotely) in this last year.
