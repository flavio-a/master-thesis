abstract={This article presents the octagon abstract domain, a relational numerical abstract domain for static analysis by abstract interpretation. It allows representing conjunctions of constraints of the form {\textpm} X {\textpm} Y ≤ c where X and Y range among program variables and c is a constant in ℤ, ℚ, or ℝ automatically inferred. Abstract elements are represented using modified Difference Bound Matrices and we use a normalization algorithm loosely based on the shortest-path closure to compute canonical representations and construct best-precision abstract transfer functions. We achieve a quadratic memory cost per abstract element and a cubic worst-case time cost per abstract operation, with respect to the number of program variables.},
