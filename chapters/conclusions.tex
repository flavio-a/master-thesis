\chapter{Conclusions and future works}

Some authors proposed \todo{ref} to use the union closure of well known over-approximation domains (eg. intervals) represented as sets of abstract elements in order to increase the precision of over-approximations. However this introduces overheads, hence the need for heuristics to decide when and how to reduce the size of this union. For instance, in the interval domain this means to decide when there are too many disjoint intervals, and then which ones should be merged into one, losing precision but gaining speed.
This approach also defines correct under-approximation domains, but again it needs heuristics to decide how to reduce the union size. In under-approximation, a safe possibility is to simply drop one interval from the union: the result is still an under-approximation of the real set of values. This idea correspond to application of the consequence rule of O'Hearn's incorrectness logic to drop a disjunction in the formula describing the final set of states, and is a perfect application of the second half of his sentence ``For incorrectness reasoning, you must remember information as you go along a path, but you get to forget some of the paths" \cite{ohearn-incorrectness-logic}: dropping unions is exactly forgetting some paths.
The problem here is how to decide which intervals to drop, but a possibility would be to take inspiration from incorrectness logic and under-approximation tools not based on abstract interpretation. The question at that point would be whether there is any difference in using abstract interpretation or logic based tools, but it may be worth investigating.

We showed limitations of approaches based on non emptying function to prove that no abstract domain exists for a given concrete one. However, example \ref{ch4:ex:infinite-lists-fix-c0} suggest a possible future research direction: what can be done if not only we constrain the function family $F$, but we also require some concrete elements to be representable? It seems to avoid some of the issues of previous approaches, and to get rid of high surjectivity, but requiring conditions on the abstract domain itself is quite a strong assumption in our opinion, since we could in principle fix the domain based on the program to analyse. So, together with a technical development, this approach would also require a conceptual justification of the choice being made.
